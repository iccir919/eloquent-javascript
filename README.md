# About
I have gone through this book many times and read sections, but never have I gone through it entirely. I am not sure of the origin of the files with the naming convention 'chapter{number}.js', but I appreciate the structure of them, so I will use them as reference, but will translate my solutions post 2015 JavaScript. My files will use the naming convention 'chapt{number}.js'.
